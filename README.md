//Add 2 Numbers
//We will ask the user to enter two numbers, add the values, and display
//the result
//Peer review - Overall data validation works well with the numbers. I would make the while loop after the WriteLine asking to enter a number so it doesn't ask the question multiple times. Also there is no data validation for the end loop. I can put anything and the program will end instead of "no".
